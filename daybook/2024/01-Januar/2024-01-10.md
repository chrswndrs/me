Preparing Scripts to analyze data based on the given formats:

 - `JSON`
 - `XML`
 - delimited
 - positional 

The Base Idea would be to create a bash script that can handle all of
the above formats. Maybe ask the user which format is being used.

Write the script in the following languages:

 - `Bash|POSIX`
 - `Python`
 - `Go`

As an example look at `~/Documents/poc/bash/cybersecurityopswithbash`.
Check also the chapters 5,6,7 in the book "Cybersecurity Ops with Bash".
