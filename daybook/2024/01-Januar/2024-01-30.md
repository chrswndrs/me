GitLab Runner setup for `Fargate`:

 - Using a EC2 as Runner
 - Configuring GitLab Runner driver on fully `serverless` `Fargate`
   cluster.

Running GitLab Runner manager serverless may offer some benefits over
the traditional scenarios, for example:

  - No server management: Not having to provision a server means not
    directly dealing with virtual machines (VMs) or bare-metal servers.
    Therefore, we don't need to worry about things like a machine or
    OS-level configuration and tuning, allowing us to focus on what is
    more important to the business.

  - Pay for what you use: In this model, we will be charged exactly for
    the resource our Docker containers will use during the time it is up
    and running. This means we can terminate the Fargate Task when we
    don't expect to use it anymore and simply restart it when we need it
    again.

Our premises:

For the scope of this article, we consider some resources were already
created following `GitLab's Autoscaling GitLab CI on AWS Fargate guide`:

  - Necessary infrastructure (`VPC` network, subnet, security group, and
    `Fargate` cluster).
  - Base container image used to run your CI jobs.
  - Task Definition to instantiate the build's task(s).
