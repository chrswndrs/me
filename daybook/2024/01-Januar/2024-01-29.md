*Possible Security Issues With Latex*:

One thing that's very important when generating LaTeX programmatically is escaping user input. Mainly because there are LaTeX commands that simply open up a shell. So not doing this opens you up to a remote code execution security vulnerability.

To specify a pdf-engine in the `pandoc` command you can use the
following command:
- `pandoc -s sample.tex --pdf-engine=xelatex -o sample.pdf`
