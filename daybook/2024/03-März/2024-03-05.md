*Deploying a Docker Container to ECS:*

	- Create the Docker image
	- Create an ECR registry
	- Tag the image
	- Give the Docker CLI permission to access your Amazon account
	- Upload your docker image to ECR
	- Create a Fargate Cluster for ECS to use for the deployment of your container
	- Create an ECS Task
	- Run the ECS Task

*ECS:*
ECS is the core of our work. In ECS we will create a task and run that
task to deploy our Docker image to a container. ECS also handles the
scaling of applications that need multiple instances running. ECS
Manages the deployment of our application.

*ECR:*
ECR is versioned storage for Docker images on AWS. ECS pulls images from
ECR when deploying.

*`Fargate`:*
`Fargate` provisions and manages clusters of compute instances. This is
amazing because:

	- You don't have to provision or manage the EC2 instances your
		application runs on
	- You are only charged for the time your app is running. In the case
		of an application that runs a periodic task and exits this can save
		a lot of money.

*Deploy from CI:*
After making an `IAM` role for the service, make sure to add the
variables to the GitLab CI variables section.
You also need variables for the name of the cluster and service (ECS)
you want to deploy to. And you also need a variable for the TASK
definition.
