An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the GetAuthorizationToken operation: User: arn:aws:iam::381492112242:user/ecr-push is not authorized to perform: ecr:GetAuthorizationToken on resource: * because no identity-based policy allows the ecr:GetAuthorizationToken action
Error: Cannot perform an interactive login from a non TTY device

This Error in the Pipeline is due to not having the correct policy attached to the IAM user for ECR.
