*Configuration Management:*
*Ansible*
  - Idempotent model
  - Ability to provision cloud infrastructure
  - "State-less", no agent required
  - Requires only SSH and Python, can run on most Linux/BSD systems
  - Agent is available for large farm deployments

*Chef & Puppet* 
  - Idempotent model
  - Client/Server or Host only models
  - Works on the instance or host level
  - Ruby-based solution and DSLs

*Cloudinit*
  - Cloud agnostic
  - Immutable resource management model

*Terraform*
  - Immutably managed instance infrastructure
  - Idempotent model for non-instance infrastructure
  - Performs CMS thru userdata or cloudinit for its instance
  - Maintains state via a local file
  - Also supports state maintenance via consul or etcd
  - Cloud agnostic

*CloudFormation*
  - Immutably managed instance infrastructure
  - Idempotent model for non-instance infrastructure
  - Native AWS tool
  - JSON-based "instructions" for infrastructure creation
  - Leverages userdata and cloudinit for instance configuration
    management

*Docker*
  - Containerization solution
  - Immutable model
  - Containers are controlled and configured by a single file
  - Immutable containers is a basis for microservices
  - Provisioning of containers through Docker Machine
  - Cloud agnostic

*SaltStack*
  - Idempotent model
  - Python-based
  - Does not require a client
  - Still supports classic client/server model
  - Support for popular Cloud providers

Ansible:

  Task are a wrapper around modules along with the metadata that ansible
  uses in the way that you want to.

  A Play consists of a list of tasks along with the hosts that this
  tasks should run on, variables and other settings.
  All those things life inside what Ansible calls a playbook, which is a
  set of plays. A playbook can have multipe tasks and can be run on
  multiple servers.



## 13:30

*Ansible Modules*
  - Modules are a unit of work
  - The represent things such as
    ‚Åª Creating files
    - Creating virtual machines
    - Editing firewall rules
    - Everything else
  - Ansible has over 750 modules
  - Modules accept arguments as key-value pairs
  *Custom Modules*
  - If you need something custom Ansible allows custom modules
  - Custom modules can be created with any language that can write JSON
    to STDOUT
  - Examples include
    - Python
    - PowerShell
    - Bash
    - Ruby
       ...

## 14:08

*Ansible Handlers, Facts, Variables, Templates*
  - Handlers reduce code and make it more efficient
  - Variables make for more reusable playbooks
  - Facts are information about hosts that you can access from variables
  - Templates are files that can be processed by the Jinja2 engine

## 16:14

*Roles*
  - Roles allow you to bundle common functionality
  - Roles allow for better code reuse
  - Roles follow a specific folder structure
  - Ansible Galaxy helps with creating and sharing roles


## 16:20

*Errors*
  - Ansible stops a playbook when it hits an error
  - Not all errors are important
  - Use "ignore_errors" to silence errors

## 16:26

*What's Next*
  - USE ANSIBLE!
  - Create playbooks and test things out
  - Read playbooks created by the Ansible community
    [https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples](Ansible Examples)
  - When you see something new, look it up
