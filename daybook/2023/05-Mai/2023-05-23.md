GitLab provides a Dependency Scanning (DS) feature that
automatically detects vulnerabilities in the dependencies of a
software project for a variety of different languages. DS relies on
the GitLab Advisory Database that is updated on a daily basis
providing information about vulnerable packages that is expressed in
the package-specific (native) semantic dialect. GitLab also recently
launched an Open Source Edition of the GitLab Advisory Database.
