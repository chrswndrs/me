# Notes for 2023-06-01

## 12:15

I've got the journal working correctly. If a new file is created it
only took the jou template and on the next day it implements the miq
template to reflect on that.

What would be nice, would be checken the questions once more and try
to implement better Q's so that they supplement each other.
