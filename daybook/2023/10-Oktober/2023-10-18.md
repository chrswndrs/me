The Docker Login Error inside the gitlab-ci pipeline:
```bash
TASK [Login to Docker Registry] ************************************************
fatal: [ec2-3-64-7-62.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com]: FAILED! => {"changed": false, "msg": "Error connecting: Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', PermissionError(13, 'Permission denied'))"}
``` 
Is due to wrong permission. It tries to login with the ansible_user: set inside the inventory file which is wrong.

The fix: 
Add `become: true` to the Task Docker Login. And it works.
