When using SSH-keys as Gitlab Ci variables there are a bunch of failure
points.

I tried this to encode the ssh-key with base64 to then be able to mask
the variable

     - cat $SSH_KEY_FILE | base64 -w0
     - mkdir -p ~/.ssh
     - echo "$SSH_PRIVATE_KEY" | base64 -d > ~/.ssh/ec2-ansible.pem
     - chmod 0400 ~/.ssh/ec2-ansible.pem
