- ansible roles repo are working on local vagrant setup
- ec2-ansible-test launched and stopped
  - pem file configured locally for ssh
    - not working (vpn?)
  TODO:
  - setup inventory file for this ec2
  - run repo and web roles against that ec2 instance.

Cons against ansible-vault:
  - every decrypt and re-encrypt, comes with the need to reset a
    password. Could also be lack with understanding
  - better solution would be to include all files that need to be
    encrypted to git-crypt conf file.
