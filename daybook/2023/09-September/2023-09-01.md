### Ansible Roles

*Role Structure*
  - Defaults: default variables with lowest precedence (e.g. port)
  - Handlers: contains all handlers
  - Meta: role metadata including dependencies to other roles
  - Tasks: plays or tasks. Tip: It's common to include tasks in main.yml
    with "when" (e.g. OS == xyz)
  - Templates: templates to deploy
  - Tests: place for playbook tests
  - Vars: variables (e.g. override port)
