## Zettelkasten

My Personal Notes, based on Zettelkasten by Niklas Luhman and highly influenced by rwxrob.

## Lab

The Coding Experiments Section

## Code-Scrapbook

Annotated, Commented Code-Blocks for Explanation, extension for Lab Files, which are without the comments.

## Blackbook

File containing bash commands that I used. Should turn into Zettels.
