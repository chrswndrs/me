# How do I do 90/90 Hips?

**3x 10-15 reps**

The 90/90 hip drill will improve your hip mobility for BJJ, just make sure you don’t 
rush through it and go as slow as possible. By working on this movement, you will improve
your performance on the mats and avoid any groin strains.

- The lead knee pointing in a 90° direction
- The rear knee pointed in the opposite direction at 90°
- Keep heels on the ground
- Rotate to the opposite side (behind you)
- Lift one leg and let the other leg follow
