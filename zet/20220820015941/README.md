# How do I do Tactical Frog Side to Side?

**Part 2: 2×30-60 secs each side**

To get more flexible hips, we change the positioning of one leg to allow more hamstrings stretch.
The hip joint is surrounded by multiple muscles (hip flexors, adductors, abductors, hamstrings, 
psoas, etc.) mobilizing the joint should be varied to get the best out of those drills.

- Same starting position
- Extend one leg to the side
- Rock back and forth without tucking your butt/flexing back
- Allow the extended leg’s toe to come off the ground: This will also improve hamstring flexibility
- On the hands or the elbows to see where you get the best stretch without flexing the lower back
