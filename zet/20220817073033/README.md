# What is the difference between locate, which, whereis and find?

`locate`: is a Unix search utility which searches through a prebuilt local database of the filesystem generated by the updatedb
  command.

`which`: searches through the directories that are in the PATH.

`whereis`: locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.

`find`: find searches recursively through any given path througout the filesystem. 
  Using the file command we can search for files by name, owner, group, permissions, 
  type, size, time modified, date and various other criteria.
