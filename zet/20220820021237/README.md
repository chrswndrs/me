# How do I do The Ski Move?

**3Ã—10-15 reps**
- Start in the standing position with arms at the side
- Bend slightly at the knees
- Keep feet planted and swing both arms to the side as knees swing in the opposite direction
- For each swing exhale
- You could add a circle with the arms to add a little shoulder mobility as well
