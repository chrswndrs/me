# How do I do Box Hip flexors Stretch?

**2x 30-60 secs each side**
This hip flexor stretch will help clear some room in the hip joint for the next drill.
Even though it’s a mobility routine, we include static stretching to help you ease into the mobility drills.
If you lack hip flexibility and want to increase it for BJJ, you can add an extra 2 sets of these.

- Block the rear ankle with something heavy (box, book, kettlebell, etc.)
- Bring the rear knee inside the ankle: this will stretch the outside of the hip as well
- We’re going for internal rotation and hip extension
