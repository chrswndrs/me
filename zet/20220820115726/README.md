# How do I Structure my Routine Day 1?

You should work on these at least 2-3 times a week, during your OFF days if you prefer. 
Some of these drills need patience and repetition for them to pay off in the long run.

There are 27 exercises in the routine. So we suggest you split it into two days.
You can simply split the exercises into upper body and lower body days. Here’s an example:

**Day 1:**

**Neck**

- Neck Flexion/Neutral/Extension/Rotation Holds – 6×3 sec hold each direction

**Shoulders**

- Shoulder CAR (standing) – 3×10 each arm
- Shoulder Mobilization Drill – 3×5-10 pulls

**Wrists**

- Wrist Flexion/Extension/Rotation – 3×10-15 reps

**Spine**

- Assisted Thoracic Flexion/Extension/Rotation – 2×10-15 reps each direction
- Bird Dog Row – 2×10-15 reps each
