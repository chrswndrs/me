# Josh Waitzkin Journaling Method

## His prescribed daily practice is summarised as follows:

- Schedule a 10 minute post-mortem journaling time at the end of your
  working day, begin by recapping what you worked on through the course
  of the day, then ask yourself:

  - “Where am I stuck?” or 
  - “What is the most important question I can ask right now?”

- Do not try and answer the question yet.

- As soon as you wake up the next morning, spend 5-10 minutes writing freely in your journal.

- At the end of each week, look back over your most important questions and journaling sessions for the week.

- Identify any patterns or gaps in your work.
