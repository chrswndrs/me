# What is a Project in Sentry?

A Project represents your Service or application in Sentry.
For example, you have one Project for your backend and your frontend.

A high level overview from the project homepage:

  - A snapshot of both errors and transactions
  - The team and team members associated with each project (remember,
    projects can be associated to multiple teams, so a project may be
    listed more than once).
  - The percentage of crash free sessions (if you have configured
    release health)
  - Deploys, if you have configured your SDK to provide a release
    identifier and are tracking deploys.
