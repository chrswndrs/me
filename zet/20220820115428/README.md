# How do I do Ankle Dorsiflexion?

**3×8-10 reps each leg**
You will notice that after a couple of reps with this, 
you will feel more freedom of motion while keeping the ankle on the ground.

- Start in a lunging position
- Put the targeted ankle inside the resistance band
- The band should be around the back of the tibia: about 2-3 inches above the ankles
- The band will pull the tibia forward: all you have to do is let the band pull you forward as you lunge

Another way to do it could be by:

- placing the band on below the ankle joint: this will pull your feet backward and you will 
  have to resist the band’s pull by lunging forward.
- With the other rear foot stepping on the band to increase tension as you dorsiflex.
