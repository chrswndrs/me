# How do I mobilize my upper Spine?

This is a comprehensive drill divided into 5 parts each one is done for 10-15 reps. 
All you need is a resistance band, a bench/chair, and floor space. 

The purpose stays the same, control and quality movement. Working on thoracic movements:

- flexion/extension,
- rotation/extension, 
- full rotation, 
- assisted thoracic rotation, and finally 
- reverse tabletop rotations.
