# 6 Strategies for Rapid Muscle Gain - Principle `#5`

**#5** Train your Ass off:
Most guys think the training program is the most important part of
gaining muscle. Well, most guys are wrong. If I didn't eat enough food I
could have trained as hard or as long as I wanted and not much would
have happened. 
Of course, the workout program is important. So Martin Rooney hooked me
up with a variation of his "Training for Warriors" routine that he uses
for high-level UFC athletes like brothers Jim and Dan Miller.

Here's what it looked like:

**Monday: Upper Body Strength** - High Calorie
This workout focused on compound exercises and used heavy weights to
build strength and target fast-twitch muscle-fibers, the ones most
primed for growth.

**Tuesday: Hurricane Day - Sprints** - Low Calorie
An Intense total-body workout that promoted rapid fat burning and power
development. Martin calls them "hurricanes" because the workouts are
like a brief, powerful storm that create disruption in the muscular,
cardiovascular, and neurological systems.
They're also some of the hardest workouts I've ever done in my life. (I
nearly passed out after my first Hurricane sessions; I took a 5-minute
nap next to the treadmill).

**Wednesday: Off - Recovery** - Low Calorie
A much needed rest for my muscles and mind.

**Thursday: Hurricane Day - Energy Circuit** - Low Calorie
A brief, intense workout comprised of five unconventional exercises
(like sledgehammer slams, medicine ball work, and rope climbs) all done
in circuit fashion.

**Friday: Upper Body Hypertrophy** - High Calorie
A second upper-body day that used less complex exercises and higher reps
to promote more muscle growth.

**Saturday: Lower Body Strength** - High Calorie
Just like the Upper Body Strength day, this workout focused on compound
exercises and used heavy weights to build strength and target
fast-twitch muscle-fibers.

**Sunday: Off - Recovery** - FAST / Off
Another rest day.
