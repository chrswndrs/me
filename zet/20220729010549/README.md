# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettel. 

* First
* Second

But, when I have an ordered or numbered list:

1. First
2. Second

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalic***?

How about something that looks like `code`?

And when I have a URL I want to print also so I always write it out like this:

https://rwx.gg
