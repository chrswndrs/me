# What is POSIX?

The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society 
for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.[1] POSIX defines both the system- and user-level
application programming interfaces (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, 
for software compatibility (portability) with variants of Unix and other operating systems.
