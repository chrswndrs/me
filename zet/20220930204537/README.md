The weight-gain nutrition plan called for way more food than he was used
to eating. So instead of focusing on counting calories - which would
have been a nightmare - we turned our attention instead to making sure
he was in a positive energy balance.

When you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight. Dr. Bernadi
knew all I'd have to do to gain weight was eat more food than I was
eating before we started the experiment. And that was easy to do, since
I was eating enough to only maintain in 170-pound body.

So how much food does it actually take to gain 20 pounds? He went
through and added everything he ate in 28 days Here it is:

- 65 pounds of meat
- 54 bananas
- 84 scoops of protein powder
- 72 pieces of bread
- 36 sweet potatoes 
- 7 jars of almond butter
