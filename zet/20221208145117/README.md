# How to get several test email adds for your private email?

If you have to use email addresses for testing, then you can use the
following format to generate as many email-adds as you want:

  - `your.name+something@domain.com`

Now you can receive emails to your add, e.g.
`christoph.wanders+test01@domain.com`,
`christoph.wanders+test01@domain.com` etc.
