# How do I do Knee Rolls?

**3×10-15 rolls in each direction**
This drill is a classic warm exercise, it also fits in as a mobility drill. If you ever played, soccer or basketball as a kid, you’re probably familiar with it.

- Start with feet shoulder-width apart
- Slight bend at the knees
- Place hands on knees and roll the knees inward for 15 rolls in each direction
- Repeat the same motion for the opposite direction for 15 rolls
