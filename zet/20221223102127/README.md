## Creating Opportunities

### Key Takeaways:

  - *Craft Comes Before Passion*
    Passion isn't a profession, it's a way of working. To achieve a
    lifestyle (and workstyle) that you love, start by cultivating rare
    and valuable skills that will set you apart.
  - *Plan To Adapt Your Plan*
    Plan flexibly, and be ready to pivot in your career if necessary.
    Always have a Plan A, B and even Z in your back pocket.
  - *Don't Settle For The Status Quo*
    Try to regularly "disrupt" your own status quo. If you're getting
    too comfortable in your current position, it's probably time to
    challenge yourself in new ways.
  - *Get Mission Critical*
    Think about your work - and where you are going - in terms of a
    larger mission. A job title is a closed objective, but a mission can
    grow with you.
  - *Luck Is A State Of Mind*
    Expose yourself to new situations, keep an open mind, and be
    proactive about pursuing chance opportunities. Luck comes to those
    who seek it.
  - *Work With Intention*
    Calibrate your career for maximum impact by working at the
    intersection of your genuine skills, interests and opportunities.
