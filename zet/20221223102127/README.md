## Creating Opportunities

### Key Takeaways:

  - *Craft Comes Before Passion*
    Passion isn't a profession, it's a way of working. To achieve a
    lifestyle (and workstyle) that you love, start by cultivating rare
    and valuable skills that will set you apart.
  - *Plan To Adapt Your Plan*
    Plan flexibly, and be ready to pivot in your career if necessary.
    Always have a Plan A, B and even Z in your back pocket.
  - *Don't Settle For The Status Quo*
    Try to regularly "disrupt" your own status quo. If you're getting
    too comfortable in your current position, it's probably time to
    challenge yourself in new ways.
  - *Get Mission Critical*
    Think about your work - and where you are going - in terms of a
    larger mission. A job title is a closed objective, but a mission can
    grow with you.
  - *Luck Is A State Of Mind*
    Expose yourself to new situations, keep an open mind, and be
    proactive about pursuing chance opportunities. Luck comes to those
    who seek it.
  - *Work With Intention*
    Calibrate your career for maximum impact by working at the
    intersection of your genuine skills, interests and opportunities.


## Building Expertise

### Key Takeaways:

  - *Stop Trying To "Be Good"*
    Give yourself permission to screw up. Once you stop trying to be
    good (and look smart), you can focus on tackling the exciting
    challenges that will help you get better.

  - *Sprint To Speed Up Mastery*
    Set aside time to regular "sprints" where you work intensively on a
    key project or skill without distraction. Then reward yourself with
    a break.

  - *Avoid The "OK Plateau"*
    Focus on practicing the hard stuff when you're developing new
    skills. As with weight lifting, you know you're making headway when
    you feel the burn.

  - *Hunger For Feedback*
    Develop a method for gathering feedback-whether it's tracking the
    numbers yourself or hiring a coach. No factor is more essential to
    growth and learning.

  - *Make Building Habits A Habit*
    Try to change one key habit a month. If you can make the behaviors
    that help you excel automatic, executing at the top of your game
    becomes significantly easier.

  - *Daily Observation Drives Progress*
    Track your progress by journaling for a few minutes every day. The
    practice will help you identify stumbling blocks, observe patterns,
    and document successes.
