# How do I do Shoulder pulls?

This a gold exercise to address any painful grinding or popping of the shoulder when youâ€™re on the mats.
To perform it, you will need a resistance band anchored in something sturdy next to the targeted arm.

Focus on putting your shoulder in the right position: you want the shoulder joint to be at its loosest 
(weakest position). You should have the least amount of ligament tension. 
**You need to do this drill 3-4 times a week for it to pay dividends.**

- Begin by lying on your back
- Pass your arm through the band: just above the biceps
- The arm should be about 60 degrees away from your body and about 30 degrees up off the ground.
- Slide further away from the anchor point, against the tension of the band
- Reach across with the opposite arm and grab the loose arm from the wrist
- Roll a little further with your body as you pull the loose arm
- Go back to the starting position
