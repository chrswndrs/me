# Why use `Fluentd`?

*Unified Logging Layer:*

`Fluentd` decouples data sources from backend systems by providing a
unified logging layer in between.
This layer allows developers and data analysts to utilize many types of
logs as they are generated. Just as importantly, it mitigates the risk
of "bad data" slowing down and misinforming your organization.
A unified logging layer lets you and your organization make better use
of data and iterate more quickly on your software.

*Simple and Easy yet Flexible:*
`Fluentd` can be set up on your laptop in less than 10 minutes. It's
500+ plugins make it compatible with dozens of data sources and data
outputs. 

*Open Source:*
`Fluentd` is `Apache 2.0 Licensed`, fully open source software. 

*Proven Reliability and Performance:* 
5,000+ data-driven companies rely on `Fluentd` to differentiate their
products and services through a better use and understanding of their
log data. In fact, according to the survey by `Datadog`, `Fluentd` is
the 7th top technologies running on Docker container environments.

Some `Fluentd` users collect data from thousands of machines in
real-time. Thanks to its small memory footprint (30~40MB), you can save
a lot of memory at scale.
