# Everyday Types in TypeScript Enums

`Enums` are a feature added to JavaScript by TypeScript which allows for
describing a value which could be one of a set of possible named
constants. Unlike most TypeScript features, this is not a type-level
addition to JavaScript but something added to the language and runtime.
Because of this, it's a feature which you should know exists, but maybe
hold off on using you are sure.
