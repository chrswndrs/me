# How do I do Tactical Frog Tibia Lift?

**Part 3: 2×10-15 reps each side**

This tactical frog helps with hip internal rotation, clearing out more space.
Make sure again your lower back doesn’t round.

- Same starting position as the first drill in this sequence
- This time with forearms on the ground
- Lift the side of one foot towards the ceiling as you bring the hip correspondent hip to touch the ground
- It’s okay if your upper body shift a bit to the side
