# 6 Strategies for Rapid Muscle Gain - Principle `#1`

**#1**: Cycle the amount of food you eat.
The nutritional Plan was split into two different kinds of days:
High-Calorie or Low-Calorie.
On the weight-training days, eat more food. This insures a huge influx
of nutrients on the days where my muscles could put them to use. On the
days of interval workouts or took off from the gym, ate a little less
food. Helps in adding weight without adding lots of body fat.

It's important to note that even on "low calorie" days it is still
involved to eat more food than previously used to. So, no matter the
day, be always in a positive energy balance. Except Sundays.
