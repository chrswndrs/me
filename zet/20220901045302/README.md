# See People as they Are: Social Intelligence

Social intelligence is the ability to see people in the most realistic
light possible. By moving past our usual self-absorption, we can learn
to focus deeply on others, reading their behavior in the moment, seeing
what motivates them, and discerning any possible manipulative
tendencies. Navigating smoothly the social environment, we have more
time and energy to focus on learning and acquiring skills. Success
attained without this intelligence is not true mastery, and will not
last.

Greene breaks this into two kinds of knowledge:
- specific knowledge of human nature: the ability to read people, to get
  a feel for how they see the world, and to understand their
  individuality.
  - You have to learn to see people as they are. You need to train
    yourself to pay less attention to the words that people say and
    greater attention to their tone of voice, the look in their eye,
    their body language - all signals that might reveal a nervousness or
    excitement that is not expressed verbally. If you can get people to
    become emotional, they will reveal a lot more. In the end, your goal
    is to identify and pierce through to what makes people unique, to
    understand the character and values that lie at their cores.
- general knowledge of human nature: which means accumulating an
  understanding of the overall patterns of human behavior that transcend
  us as individuals, including some of the darker qualities we often
  disregard.
  - The 7 Deadly Realities:
  *Envy:* It is our nature to constantly compare ourselves to others -
  in terms of money, looks, coolness, intelligence, popularity, or any
  number of categories. In general, it is by standing out too much that
  you will spark this ugly emotion, and so it is best to maintain a
  nonthreatening exterior and to blend in well with the group, at least
  until you are so successful it no longer matters.
  *Conformism:* When people form groups of any type, a kind of
  organizational mind-set inevitably sets in. Although members of the
  group might trumpet their tolerance and celebration of people's
  differences, the reality is that those who are markedly different make
  them feel uncomfortable and insecure, calling the values of the
  dominant culture into question.
  *Rigidity:* The world has become increasingly complex in many ways,
  and whenever we humans face a situation that seems complicated out
  response is to resort to a kind of artificial simplicity, to create
  habits and routines that give us a sense of control. The best strategy
  is to simply accept rigidity in others, outwardly displaying deference
  to their need for order. On your own, however, you must work to
  maintain your open spirit, letting go of bad habits and deliberately
  cultivating new ideas.
  *Self-obsessiveness:* In the work environment, we almost inevitably
  think first and foremost of ourselves. In general, in your
  interactions with people, find a way to make the conversation revolve
  around them and their interests, all of which will go far to winning
  them to your side.
  *Laziness:* We all have the tendency to want to take the quickest,
  easiest path to our goals, but we generally manage to control our
  impatience; we understand the superior value of getting what we want
  through hard work. In general, be wary of people who want to
  collaborate - they are often trying to find someone who will do the
  heavier lifting for them.
  *Flightiness:* We like to make a show of how much our decisions are
  based on rational considerations, but the truth is that we are largely
  governed by our emotions, which continually color our perceptions.
  *Passive Aggression:* The root cause of all passive aggression is the
  human fear of direct confrontation - the emotions that a conflict can
  churn up and the loss of control that ensues.
