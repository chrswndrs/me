# How Do I do Shoulder Cars? 

**Shoulder CAR (standing) – 3×10 each arm**

Shoulder Controlled Articular Rotations are deliberate slow movements to help with the control component we mentioned earlier. If you stick with these for a few months, we guarantee you, the difference in mobility, flexibility, and even strength in your shoulder will be noticeable. A tip performs it correctly: “imagine the air getting thicker as you circle your arms”.

Start in the standing position with feet firmly planted:
- Close your fist and tighten the core
- Externally rotate the targeted shoulder
- Lift the palm while raising your arms overhead as slow as possible
- Feel the engagement of the lower chest
- When the arm reaches ear level, the palm should face the side of the head
- Do not: rotate your upper body, shrug up your shoulder, bend at the elbow
- Turn the palm facing the other side
- Continue rotating the arm behind you (as if you’re trying to hide your hands)
- Direct your thumb back behind you as you lift again: you should feel the first stretch at the shoulder
- Midway through your circle externally rotate your shoulder to continue moving your arm up towards the ceiling
- Finally, lower your arm to the starting position
