# How do I do Tactical Frog Depth?

**Part 1: 2Ã—10-15 reps**
This will help you gauge how deep you can go into hip flexion without flexing back.
It will also teach the body to stay in hip flexion while keeping the lower back neutral.

- Start in the tabletop position
- Spread the knees wide: the distance between them should be the same as when you perform a bodyweight squat
- Toes in line with knees
- Rock back and forth
- When you feel your butt tucking, extend the lower back to keep it in a neutral position
- Brace your core (as if getting punched)
