# Why did the Greeks have to words for Time?

The Greeks had two words for Time. 
 - Chronos
 - Kairos
The God Chronos was represented by an elderly man with grey-haired, and
the name connotes the literal ticking clock.
Kairos is different. While it is difficult to translate precisely, it
refers to time that is opportune, right, different.

Chronos is quantitative; kairos is qualitative.
