# Everyday Types in `TypeScript`

The most common types of values you'll find in JavaScript code, and
explain the corresponding ways to describe those types in `TypeScript`.
Types can also appear in many more places than just type annotations.

The primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

  JavaScript has three very commonly used primitives. Each has a
  corresponding type in `TypeScript`. As you might expect, these are the
  same names you'd see if you used the JavaScript `typeof` operator on a
  value of those types:
    - `string` represents string values like "Hello, world"
    - `number` is for numbers like 42. JS does not have a special
      runtime value for integers, so there's no equivalent to `int` or
      `float` - everything is simply `number`
    - `boolean` is for the two values `true` and `false`
The two names String, Number, and Boolean (starting with capital
letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will
very rarely appear in your code. Always use string, number, or boolean
for types.
