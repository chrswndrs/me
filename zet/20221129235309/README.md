# What are Namespaces?

Namespaces provide a layer of isolation. Docker uses namespaces of
various kinds to provide the isolation that containers need in order to
remain portable and remain from affecting the reminder of the host
system.
Each aspect of a container runs in a separate namespace and its access
is limited to that namespace.

      #Docker #container #namespaces #devops
