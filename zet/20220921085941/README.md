# What is PostgreSQL Replication?

Postgresql replication is a process in which you would have a primary
Database and you replicate that data to on to a replicate server to
preserve the data and prevent data loss.

postgresql follows a simple replication model in which the writing of
data will be sent to primary node. This primary node can take the
changes and send them to a secondary node.
