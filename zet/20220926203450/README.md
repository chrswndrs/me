# Replace Coffee with this Morning Cocktail

- Use a blend of green tea and fermented black tea, combining slightly
  different pharmacokinetics and biological half-lives, so respective
  peak plasma (blood) concentrations of stimulants and other compounds
  are staggered. Instead of one single high point and then a rapid
  descent into fatigue, you have multiple high points.

- This can be extended further if you include a tea like yerba mate
  (e.g. Cruz de Malta), which includes three xanthine alkaloids. For
  our, purposes, you can think of these xanthines as "stimulants": good
  old caffeine (by weight, often <50% compared to coffee), theophylline
  (found in green tea), and theobromine (the primary alkaloid in cocoa
  and chocolate). 

- If on theobromine and/or theophylline as uppers, instead of primary
  caffeine, you can probably quit stimulants cold turkey without
  caffeine-withdrawal headaches. This can be a massive competitive and
  health advantage, as you can cycle off of stimulants to minimize
  tolerance development.

- But - TF is not a doctor. I am also none. NOTE: Excessive theophylline
  and theobromine have plenty of adverse effects, particularly when
  consumed with fat like coconut oil (i.e. "dose dumping"). 

- Incredients:
  - black tea, e.g. puh-err, ember
  - green tea, kabuse sencha jpn
  - coconut oil 
  - butter (gras fed)
  Mix green and black tea, let it steep(1st) for 40-60sec. Then poor it
  away > If you want to decaffeinate!
  Steep tea again and let it sit for about 2 mins.
  Leave a little bit of hot water and mix 1tbsp of Butter (gras fed) and
  1tbsp of coconot oil with the water, you can steer it up. Then add the
  second steeped version of the tea and voila.
