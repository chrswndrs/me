# How do I Mobilize Wrists?

The wrist is involved in mainly 4 movements: flexion, extension, pronation, and supination. 
The flexors muscles tend to get tight due to the gripping movements repeated in BJJ.
Working on the wrist mobility drills will be done in 4 parts:

**Wrist extension – 3×10-15 reps each direction**
- Start with the tabletop position
- Palms on the floor with wrists in extension
- Rock back and forth to mobilize the joint (that’s one rep)
- Repeat the same movement but with the palm facing outwards: this will place a great stretch on the forearm flexors

**Wrist Flexion – 3×10-15 reps**
- Starting with the same position as the previous drill
- Place the back of your hands on the floor
- Rock back and forth (that’s one rep)
- Go by feel and never push through pain: you should only feel mild discomfort

**Wrist extension with palms facing each other – 3×10-15 reps**
- With the same starting position as the previous drill
- Place your palms so that they face each other
- Start rocking side to side to hit the required mobility

**Rotated Wrists – 3×10-15 reps**
- Place your palms out this time by rotating them 180 degrees (or as much as you can without pain)
- Start rocking back and forth to mobilize the wrist
