# How do I do Rocking Chair?

**3Ã—15 reps each leg**
This exercise is a full-body drill that focuses on knee support. 
This is a classic BJJ warm-up drill that will not only improve your knee mobility 
but also your BJJ performance.

- Start in the sitting position
- Rock back and let the momentum bring you up
- As you come up the rear knee internally rotates: the tibia moves like a windshield wiper
- The lead knee lunges forward for support
- You can put your hand on the floor for support
