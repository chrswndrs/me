# How do I do Assisted Thoracic Rotation?

**2Ã—10-15 reps each side**
- Anchor a resistance band at shin level/knee level
- Start in the tabletop position: hips should be touching ankles
- Slide one arm through the resistance band
- Place that arm behind your neck
- Let it slowly pull your upper thoracic spine to 90 degrees
- Pull back and rotate until your elbow touches the opposite hand
