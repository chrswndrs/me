# How do I do Bird Dog Row?

This exercise will improve thoracic mobility and help mitigate any lower back pain that occurs from BJJ practice.
The constant rotation of the lower body could be a cause of lower back pain to some. 
Bird Dog Rows teach your spine to resist rotation movements, reducing the strain that occurs to the lower back
and hips. All you need is a light dumbbell or kettlebell

**2Ã—10-15 reps each side**
- Start in tabletop position: do not allow shifting of the hips
- You could put a foam roller or do it next to a door frame to avoid shifting hips
- Extend the hip back
- Do not overextend the hip just kick the leg back and locked out
- Use the arm opposite to the extended hip to grab the weight
- Slowly row up with the weight without letting the elbow go past your back
- Keeping core tight perform the row with the hip extension for 10-15 reps on each side
