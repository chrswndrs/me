**FASTING DAY (SUNDAY)**

I fasted every Sunday with the goal to reboot my insulin sensitivity and
carb tolerance before another 6 days of big eating. The rules were
simple:

Rule 1: Stop eating by 10pm on Saturday.

Rule 2: On Sunday, have 3 “meals” consisting of the following:
- 1L water with 1/2 serving greens powder
- 15g BCAA’s
- 1 cup of green tea

Rule 3: Break the fast at 10pm Sunday night by eating 1 pound of any
protein with 3-4 cups of veggies.
