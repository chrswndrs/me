# What is LSP - Language Server Protocol?

The Language Server Protocol is an open, JSON-RPC-based protocol for use
between source code editors or integrated development environments and
servers that provide programming language-specific features.
The goal of the protocol is to allow programming language support to be
implemented and distributed independently of any given editor or IDE.

The Language Server Protocol (LSP) defines the protocol used between an
editor or IDE and a language server that provides language features like
auto complete, go to definition, find all references etc.
