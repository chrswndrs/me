# 6 Strategies for Rapid Muscle Gain - Principle `#3`

something for a little while, see how it works, and if you need to, make
a small change and repeat the steps.

For this experiment Beradi started him off with a lot of food, enough to
where he'd be in a caloric surplus and gain muscle. But he didn't
overload him as much as he could have. Not at first, at least. He wanted
to leave a little wiggle room to make changes if needed.

In both Weeks 3 and 4 we strategically added more calories to help push
me past a plateau when my weight stalled at 178 pounds.
