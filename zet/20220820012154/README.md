# How do I do Assisted Thoracic Flexion/Extension?

**2×10-15 reps**
- To start place both hands behind your neck
- Kneel on the ground
- Place your elbows on the bench/chair
- Lean back as much as possible: this place the stretch on your lats
- Push down back on the chair flexing the spine as much as possible (that’s one rep)
- The chair has to be at least at chest level or higher
