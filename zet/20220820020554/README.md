# How do I do Sacroiliac Joint Mobilization?

The SI joint looks kind of like two fists going together: It should not move more than
a couple of millimetres because it absorbs most of the stress coming from the upper body and the lower body.
Most SI joint pain comes from too much movement due to a lack of hip mobility. 
You could do some soft tissue work before those drills on the SI joint, 
to help ease into them. Here we go through this mobilization technique to improve hip mobility.

- Figure 4 stretch – 2×60 secs each leg 
- Start by lying on your back
- Feet up on a wall
- Cross one leg on top of the other
- Let the extended leg fall until you form a figure-4 with legs
- Push on the crossed leg: do not move your pelvis up! Keep your butt on the floor.
