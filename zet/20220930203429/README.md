# 6 Strategies for Rapid Muscle Gain - Principle `#2`

**#2** Use Intermittent Fasting:
Every Sunday do a 24-hour fast to offset the inevitable fat gain that
would normally come with an eating plan like this. The goal was to be in
a caloric surplus - an anabolic state - six days per week, eating more
calories than you burn which would lead to muscle growth.

Be in a extreme caloric deficit one day per week, which would help reset
insulin sensitivity, boost growth hormone secretion, and help stimulate
fat loss while preserving lean mass.
