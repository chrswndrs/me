# The Weight Gain Menu - Week 3 and 4

My menu on Weeks 3 and 4 followed the same base menu as above but we
strategically added calories. In Week 3, we introduced a Super-Shake
(basically a fancy protein shake) because by this time I was tired of
chewing. Drinking a shake was much easier.

Hereâ€™s what we added:

WEEK 3 ADDITIONS

**High-Calorie Day Super Shake (Monday, Friday, Saturday)**

- 8 oz unsweetened almond milk
- 2 Tbsp heavy cream/whipping cream
- 1 scoop protein powder
- Handful frozen raspberries
- Handful frozen blueberries
- Low-Calorie Day Super Shake (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)

- 8 oz unsweetened almond milk
- 2 oz coconut milk
- 1 scoop protein powder
- 2 Tbsp cacoa nibs or 99% chocolate
- 1 Tbsp favorite nut butter

WEEK 4 ADDITIONS

We continued to add more food to my existing meals in Week 4.

**Additions to High-Calorie days**

- 1 banana to my breakfast pudding (for a total of 3 bananas)
- 1 chocolate square to my breakfast pudding (for a total of 3 chocolate
squares)
- 1 scoop Purple Wraath to my workout drink (for a total of 2 scoops)
- 1 scoop Universal Torrent to my post-workout drink (for a total of 4
scoops)
- 2 Tbsp nut butter to my breakfast toast side-dish (for a total of 4
Tbsp)
- 1 Tbsp of jam to my breakfast toast side-dish (for a total of 2 Tbsp)
- 2 Tbsp heavy cream to my Super Shake (for a total of 4 Tbsp)
- 1 scoop protein to my Super Shake (for a total of 2 scoops)

**Additions to Low-Calorie days**

- 1 banana to my breakfast pudding (for a total of 3 bananas)
- 1 chocolate square to my breakfast pudding (for a total of 3 chocolate
squares)
- 1 Tbsp nut butter to my breakfast toast side-dish (for a total of 2
Tbsp)
- 2 oz coconut milk to my Supe Shake (for a total of 4 oz)
- 1 scoop protein to my Super Shake (for a total of 2 scoops)
- 1 Tbsp chocolate to my Super Shake (for a total of 3 Tbsp)
- 1 Tbsp nut butter to my Super Shake (for a total of 2 Tbsp)

These were seemingly small changes that made a big impact on how much
weight I gained this week.
