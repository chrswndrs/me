# What is a Unified Logging Layer?

The Unified Logging Layer is still in its infancy, but its strategic
significance is already underscored by open source projects such as
Kafka (`LinkedIn's` key data infrastructure to unify their log data) and
`Fluentd`. The reader is strongly encouraged to start thinking how to
evolve their organization towards building a Unified Logging Layer to
make sure they can take full advantage of all the information buried in
their log data.
