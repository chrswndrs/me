# What is Multipass Ubuntu?

`Multipass` is a tool to generate cloud-style Ubuntu VMs quickly on Linux,
`macOS`, and Windows.

`Multipass` has a growing library of images that give you the ability to
launch purpose-built VMs, or custom VMs you've configured yourself
through its powerful cloud-init interface.

Developers can use Multipass to prototype cloud deployments and to
create fresh, customized Linux dev environments on any machine. Mac and
Windows users can use Multipass as the quickest way to get an Ubuntu
command line on their system.
