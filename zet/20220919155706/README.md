# What is telescope?

`telescope.nvim` is a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists. Community
driven builtin pickers, sorters and previewers.
Telescope is a fuzzy file finder and pattern matching machine.

`ripgrep` is required for `live_grep` and `grep_string` and is the first
priority for `find_files`. We also suggest you install one native
telescope sorter to significantly improve sorting performance. Take a
look at `telescope-fzf-native.nvim` or `telescope-fzy-native.nvim`
