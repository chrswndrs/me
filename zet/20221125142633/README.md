# Low Rep, heavy work (Weight training)

Heavy training, if not overdone, even energizes you!
Low rep heavy work for example three sets of three reps at a ninety
percent of the athlete's maximum (`3x3@90%1RM`), is often employed by
Russian coaches to produce a tonic effect on their athletes' nervous
system.
