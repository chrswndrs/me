# How do I do Inside and Outside Leg Pummelling?

**3Ã—10-15 reps each direction**
This drill is simulating a fight with someone trying to pass your guard.
This is a rotational movement with the tibia and knee because like we said, knees can still rotate.

- Start by lying on your back
- Feet in the air
- Pummel 15 reps to the inside
- Repeat the same for the opposite direction
