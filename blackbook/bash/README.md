# Bash Scripting

* `echo Foo` - print `Foo` to standard output
* `echo $?` - display last return value
* `printf` - print with escapes and formatting

# Tips
 * Get good with basic `vim` commands and just repeat with .
 * Never use extensions on executables on UNIX/Linux
 * Use `command -v` instead of `which` in scripts
 * Make sure you grok `/usr/bin/env` and `PATH` dangers
 * Grok pros and cons of aliases, functions, and commands
 * Precede anything with backslash to disable aliases, functions
 * Use `env` to see environment variables
 * Grok shell return codes
 * Grok integers, bits, bytes, and bases (binary, decimal, octal, hex, base64)
 * Use obase=2 to convert to binary from decimal
 * Grok basic bash/shell data types: number/integer, string, boolean
 * Remember, there are no floats in bash
 * Grok difference between single and double quoting strings
 * Grok "duck typing"
 * Grok code block and variable scope
