# Code Scrapbook

This is the place where I collect cool annotated, explained Code (snippets) blocks.

## What is a Scrapbook?

As I heard of it, it is from the Marketing world where the people would write Ads in a scrapbook that made them 
buy a specific product.
On this Repo the purpose should be something similar, where I try to explain some code-snippet, or code-blocks to myself 
and have them documented with lots of comments, seperate from the stuff I would have in a production-repo.
